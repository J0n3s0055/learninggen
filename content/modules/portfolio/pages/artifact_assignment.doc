Assignment Brief for Assignment 2: ePortfolio
Module Code: EL6052
Module Title: E-learning Theories and Practices
Semester: Spring 2024
Submission Time/Date: Week 13 (Sunday, April 28th by 11:55 pm)
Marks: 80% of module

== What is the purpose of this assignment?
ePortfolios are an increasingly more common content delivery medium. This
assignment gives you an opportunity to develop, write, design, and publish
content in this new medium. It also enables you to display your career
progression and your writing and design skills.

== What is the assignment task?
Your task is to develop an e-portfolio (a personalised electronic collection of
artefacts1 that represent your particular interests and accomplishments) relating
to the MA programme. Artefacts can include technical projects, manuals,
reports, proposals, slides, podcast recordings, and so on. You should carefully
pick FOUR artefacts that best represent your skills and future career plans.

Please note that we will not be grading the quality of your artefacts, and you can
improve previously submitted artefacts, based on lecturer feedback, if you wish.
You should first present a brief overview of each of the four artefacts on
one screen and then provide links or buttons to each artefact page. Artefacts
should ideally display within the browser or e-portfolio tool. Viewers should not
have to install any applications to view the artefact, with the exception of zip
files, which viewers will have to download and unzip.

If the artefact cannot
work/display when the viewer clicks on it, you should consider picking another
artefact or developing a screencast demonstrating what the artefact can do.
Remember: You are developing this e-portfolio for potential employers, so the
onus is on you to develop a useful e-portfolio.

Each artefact page should include a #personal reflection (approx. 400 words per
artefact)#, which explains why you chose the artefact, #which skills are
demonstrated in the artefact#, and #what you learned from developing/writing the
artefact#. You should also #include in-text citations# in the reflection, to justify why
the artefact was designed/written that way. Each artefact page should contain a
link to the relevant artefact, if it is not visible on that page.

1 While the term ‘artefact’ is frequently used in e-portfolio research, do not use this term
in your e-portfolio, as employers are less likely to know what an artefact is; instead, use
terms like ‘assignment’ or ‘project’.
2 Students who completed our Graduate Certificate programme can include artefacts
from that programme.

You can also link to specific entries in your EL6082 blog, where appropriate.
However, if you developed some artefacts before the blog assignment
commenced, you do not have to link to a relevant blog posting for that reflection
piece.
The EL6082 blog assignment cannot be one of the four artefacts.
Finally, your e-portfolio should include a standalone two-page CV, in PDF format,
which is tailored to the technical writing, content development, and/ or e-
learning industry.
The ePortfolio should include the following content:
 A home page
 An About page describing the ePortfolio
 Information pages that correspond to the site’s purpose outlined in this
brief.
You may want to consider:
 What elements you will include (multimedia, content, images/graphics,
audio)?
 What navigation system will be appropriate?
 What source documents and data will you include?
 What headings will you use?
 What colour palette will you use?
 How will you design your ePortfolio (adhere to good information design)?
 What techniques will you use to make it easier for the reader to access the
content?
What steps are involved?
1. Create an ePortfolio using the software of your choice. The lab sheets will
guide you through the process of setting up an ePortfolio in Weebly, and in
Wix (Although you may use any tool to create your site, we will support
these tools).
2. Note the URL for your website. You must ensure that your lecturers can
access your website from this URL (make sure that you give your lecturers
access to your website when you are setting it up).
3. You must submit the URL for your website to Brightspace before 11:55 pm
on Sunday, April 28th. To submit your URL, from the EL6052 Brightspace
site, click on Course Tools in the navigation bar. Click on Assignments.
Click on Assignment 2: E-Portfolio. Paste your URL into the Text
Submission field. Click on Submit. There is also a link to submit your
URL from the Week six folder.
How will the E-Portfolio assignment be graded?
Your e-portfolio should:

Assignment 2: ePortfolio EL6052 AY 2023/24
 Include a brief introduction about who you are and why you created the e-
portfolio.
 Link to four artefacts that best represent your particular interests and/or
accomplishments.
 Include a tailored two-page CV (PDF format).
 Include personal reflections (approx. 400 words per artefact), which:
o Describe why you chose each artefact.
o Explain which skills are demonstrated in each artefact.
o Explain what you learned from developing/writing each artefact.
o Include in-text citations to relevant theories.
o Link to specific blog entries (where appropriate).
 Demonstrate high quality information design (both text and visuals).
 Be user-friendly (navigation and layout).
 Use an appropriate writing style, which is suitable for the target audience.
 Incorporate suitable referencing (Harvard style), where applicable.
A grading rubric will be issued for this assignment. The ePortfolio content must
be your own original work. You will be awarded no marks for plagiarism.
Failure to submit the URL for your site will result in a fail grade (i.e., zero
percent) for the assignment.
Generative AI
Use of ChatGPT or other generative AI tools is permitted only for the creation
of images. If you use it for this purpose, you must declare and explain details of
your usage in a statement at the start of the assignment. You must acknowledge
the tool and prompts used and summarise how you used the output. Failure to
do so will result in failure of that component of the module if use of generative AI
is detected.

lecturers. You can also use the online discussion forum so that other students
can benefit from any additional information provided.
When will you get feedback on your assignment?
You will be given written feedback in Brightspace at the end of the semester.
