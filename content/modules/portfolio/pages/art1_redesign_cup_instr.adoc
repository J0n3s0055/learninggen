== Reflection

=== Why I chose the instructions brochure

This assignment was the kind of task that I particularly enjoy doing as I like clarifying information and making it easier for the consumer to read and understand.

=== Which skills were demonstrated

The skills demonstrated were:

Analysing the graphic according to some of Markel & Selber's six characteristics of good technical communication (Markel and Selber 2021), key attributes emphasised by Gurak and Lannon (2007), and the graphical elements (Web Accessibility Initiative), particularly:

* Clarity
* Well organised/ logically arranged
* Targeted
* Relevant
* Comprehensive
* Accessible
* Graphics "unfriendly", contrast, clear fonts

Although the Web Accessibility Initiative deals primarily with online graphics, many principles also apply to print graphics.

The improvements included:

* Improving the English to first language speaker standard. Separating the languages (English and Chinese were mixed in the original brochure, Chinese was not included in the redesigned brochure).

* Restructuring the information in a logical flow and in distinct sections.

* Adding information in compliance with safety standards i.e., including the necessary warnings and cautions.

* Adding troubleshooting help and contact information.

* Finding and adding missing information and graphics.

* Creating a more visually appealing layout.

* Adding a table of contents and an index.

* Adding a glossary

* Adding instructions for care of the product

* Adding a QR code for easy access to the One is All website

Improvements to the graphical elements:

Contrast improved, the original colour combination was bad contrast, tiring to read.

=== What I learnt from improving the instructions brochure

* How to systematically analyse the content against Markel and Selber's, and Gurak and Lannon's characteristics of good communication.

* How to target a particular audience (English speakers) and tailor the content to them.

* To provide help and support possibilities so that consumers can solve problems with the product themselves.

* To improve the readability of the brochure, including graphics, admonitions, and text to enhance the user's understanding.

* To pay attention to detail, and use clear and concise language.

* To make the information easy to find and understand.
