:doctitle: Graphic Critique: The Great Thirst

== Brief

Critique THREE visuals and redesign ONE of these visuals, providing a rationale for the changes.

The before and redesigned (after) graphic is presented here.

[.Der große Durst]

s|German|English

|Der große Durst
|The big/ great Thirst

|Geflogene Entfernungen und Kerosinverbrauch in Europa, 2018
|Flight distances and kerosine consumption in Europe, 2018

|Anteil von Flügen nach zurückgelegter Distanz, in Prozent
|Percentage of total flights by distance category

|Anteil dieser Flüge am Gesamtkerosinverbrauch, in Prozent
|Percentage of total kerosine consumption per distance category

The graphic accompanies an article that challenges the popular/ political belief that short flights within Europe produce the majority of flight related pollution. As a result of this belief, several countries are introducing more trains, and night trains, between cities or banning flights shorter than a certain distance in favour of train trips. The graphic shows the data in percentage, per distance category, on the number of flights within and from Europe in 2018, and their relative total fuel consumption, indicating which distance category is the biggest polluter.

== Reflection

=== Why I chose the Graphic

This was an interesting graphic to assess as

* I could see that there was several problems with it with regard to chart junk, and being "unfriendly".
* I felt that the graphic supported the challenge, but it could have done so more effectively: how it displayed the information lessened the full impact of the message.

=== Which Skills were Demonstrated

The skills demonstrated were

* applying the learning on effective graphic design in analysing the graphic for its positive and negative aspects.
* systematically noting the problems and suggesting improvements.

The graphic is from a popular but serious political magazine and could have shown the data more clearly and accurately without upsetting their readers.

I extracted data from the original chart and recreated the chart using Excel. I  also created second chart which shows the comparison of fuel consumption per flight distance in a more clearly.

=== What I learnt from analysing and improving the graphic

* I learnt to start with the data and, by recreating the graphs, to assess the accuracy of the original. Graphical representations are easier to look at and are therefore easier to misuse to distort the message. I wasn't sure whether this was the case until I looked at the data. However, it confirmed the message.

* I learnt how a graphic can be improved by following the guidelines of e.g., Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Tufte's Visual display of Quantitative Information (1983), and that these guidelines are still relevant despite being several decades old.

Finally, I learnt that there are two areas in which I could improve on in the future that I believe would make me a better technical writer:

* graphic design and
* data analysis

Although my redesigned charts were clearer, they were simple and not very professional looking. I see that being able to manipulate more complex data and  present it in a more visually appealing way would be good skills to have as a technical communicator.
